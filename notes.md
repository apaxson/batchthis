#Notes
## Ideas

* Batch
  * Using FSM for state management
    * Fermenter states (clean, dirty, in-use)
    * Batch States (racking = transition --> state = secondary)
  * Track pitch rate for yeast
  * Track yeast viability
  * Track additions
    * SO2
    * Acid
    * Salts
    * GoFerm
    * Fermaid-O
    * Fermaid-K
    * DAP
* Types of tanks
    * Fementing Vessel
    * Brite Tanks
    * Mixing Tank
    * Propogation Tank
* Types of Lab Tests
    * SO2
    * pH
    * YAN
    * DO
    * Turbidity
    * Yeast Viability
    * TA
* Update AddTest form for specific tests
* Setup Page
    * Admin
        * Create Tanks
        * Setup Default config (Load Defaults button)
        

## Production License
  * Inventory
    * Raw Goods
    * Mead Inventory (bottles/barrels/tanks)
  * Batch
    * Is there a need or usefulness to use both FSM and ViewFlow workflow engine together?
    * Sequential steps with state?
  * User management
    * Task notifications
    * Task Assignments
    * User Roles (lab tech, production tech, shipping)
  * Reporting
    * TTB?
    * Production Schedule
    * Production Forecast
    * Sales Forecast
