# batchthis
An online django-based app for journaling and tracking the making of low-alcoholic beverages, including graphs.  Primarily Wine and Mead, but also others like Cider and Beer.  

Each "batch" is a specific recipe that can be used in one fermenter, or multiple.  It will also track fermenter status and maintenance.  

Not a recipe builder, but meant for everything after the recipe.

Lots of features and possibilities.

Working on now:
* Fermenter workflow and maintenance
* Batch tracking and testing
* Graphing of tests

Future:
* Import recipes from Beersmith
* Inventory Tracking??
